# VitisDigitalMorphometricAnalysis
# This is R code used to analyze digital leaf scans from Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris leaves grown in a common garden at the Misosuri Botanical Garden. A detailed description can be found in: Klein et al. "Digital morphometrics of two North American grapevines (Vitis: Vitaceae) quantifies leaf variation between species, within species, and among individuals"
